# Project Title:

### Brick Breaker Game Simulation

# Description:

### This project is a simulation of the classic Brick Breaker game, developed using Java Swing as part of an advanced programming course during my undergraduate studies. 
### The primary objective was to learn and apply graphics programming in Java using Swing. 
### The game includes features such as ball movement, paddle control, collision detection, and levels of bricks to break.

# Features:

### Brick Levels: Bricks are arranged in multiple levels of varying difficulty.
### Collision Detection: Accurate detection of ball-brick collisions.
### Score Tracking: Playerâ€™s score is updated based on a linear function depending on bricks destroyed and elapsed time.
### Graphics Rendering: Custom rendering for the game elements using Java Swing.
### History Board: Displays top scores from previous game sessions.
### Theme Song: Plays background music during gameplay for a more immersive experience.
### Levels: Multiple levels of varying difficulty.
### Ball Color Customization: Players can change the ball's color before starting a new game.

# Technologies Used:

### Java
### Java Swing for graphical user interface (GUI) components and game rendering.
### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for structuring the game components.
### Event listeners for mouse control and game interaction.
